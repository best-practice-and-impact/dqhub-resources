<h1>Data quality resources</h1>
<p>In the Government Data Quality Hub we are developing resources to help people with their data quality work.</p>
  <p>These resources are currently in development:
  <ul>
    <li><A Href="https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/dqhub-resources/raw/main/DQMatrixV1.pptx">Data Quality Practices Matrix</a> V1 - A matrix to assess current data quality practice and identify areas for improvement</li>
    <li><A Href="https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/dqhub-resources/raw/main/DQ_Evidence_Base_v1.pptx">Data Quality Evidence Base</a> - A collection of evidence that can help to support a business case for data quality work</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/dqhub-resources/raw/main/DRAFT_basic_DQAP_Template.xlsx">A draft template that can be used or adapted for recording data quality action plans</a></p>
  
  <p>These resources support our Data Quality Action Plan training. They're simplified to illustrate lessons from the training package and shouldn't be taken as best practice measurements for similar datasets.
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/dqhub-resources/raw/main/TrainingResource_Hypothetical_DQAP_Design.pptx">Example design of a data quality action plan for a hypothetical dataset</a>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/dqhub-resources/raw/main/TrainingResource_Hypothetical_DQAP_Results.xlsx">Example results of a data quality action plan on a hypothetical dataset<a/>
  </ul>
  </p>  
  
  <p>These resources are designed for use in public sector organisations.
    <br>If you have any feedback on these resources, please email <a href="mailto:DQHub@ons.gov.uk">DQHub@ons.gov.uk</a></br>
